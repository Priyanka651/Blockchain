## Detailed Explanation

**What is the Blockchain?**


A blockchain is a distributed database that contains a list of records (data).
Distributed means that instead of being stored on a central device somewhere, the entire database is actively synced and stored on a bunch of other devices.
This is called a peer-to-peer network, much like how Napster was a peer-to-peer network for sharing music files.
The individual records in this distributed database are referred to as blocks, which are linked together and secured through cryptography.
The data contained in a blockchain is immutable, which means that it can't be changed. In this context, it's tamper-proof.
Use cases for Smart Contracts
Because of the unique properties associated with smart contracts (decentralized, secure, speed, savings as compared to hiring third party intermediaries, backups, etc..), they lend themselves to a variety of use cases.
Voting
Since the dawn of every government, elections have been rigged and tampered with. Smart contracts can make it impossible for individuals to modify voting records.
Record Keeping
This goes hand in hand with voting above, because votes are simply records that detail an individual and their candidate selection.
But other types of record keeping include establishing and securing electronic medical records, case history for law, etc..
Digital Identities
IOT (Internet Of Things)
Real Estate & Mortgages
Auctions
What is Solidity?
Solidity is the language that you can use to code the actual smart contracts.
The syntax is very similar to JavaScript and it's designed with the Ethereum Virtual Machine in mind.
