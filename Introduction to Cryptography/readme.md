Cryptography is the science and practice of securing communication and information from unauthorized access or tampering. It uses mathematical techniques to protect data and ensure its confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity.

Key Concepts in Cryptography:
Confidentiality: Ensures that information is accessible only to those authorized to access it. This is typically achieved using encryption.
Integrity: Verifies that the data has not been altered during transmission or storage.
Authentication: Confirms the identity of the parties involved in communication.
Non-repudiation: Ensures that a party cannot deny the authenticity of their signature or communication.
Types of Cryptography:
Symmetric Cryptography:

The same key is used for both encryption and decryption.
Examples: AES (Advanced Encryption Standard), DES (Data Encryption Standard).
Asymmetric Cryptography (Public-Key Cryptography):

Uses a pair of keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption.
Examples: RSA, ECC (Elliptic Curve Cryptography).
Hashing:

Converts data into a fixed-length string of characters, which is unique to the input.
Used for integrity checks and password storage.
Examples: SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms), MD5.
Applications:
Secure Communication: HTTPS, email encryption (PGP).
Data Protection: Encrypting files or storage devices.
Authentication: Digital signatures, two-factor authentication.
Blockchain: Ensures transaction integrity and security.
