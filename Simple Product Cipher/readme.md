## Product Cipher

Product Cipher uses
Diffusion
Hide the relationship between plaintext and ciphertext
To rearranging or spreading out the bits in the message so that any redundancy in the plaintext is spread out over the ciphertext.
Diffuse statistical property of plaintext digit across a range of ciphertext digits
i.e. each plaintext digits affects value of many ciphertext digits
Can be achieved by Transposition Cipher
Confusion
Hide the relationship between ciphertext and key
Can be achieved by Substitution Cipher
Substitution Cipher includes Caesar Cipher, Monoalphabetic Cipher, and Vigenere Cipher.
Design of Product Cipher
Round
Each application of Confusion and Diffusion is known as a round.
Iteration
The repeated application of rounds is called iteration.
